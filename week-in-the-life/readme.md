# Week in the Life (WITL) - Scenario 1

This scenario focuses heavily on being able to be active in my daily life: assisting efforts like Rebuilding Together projects, working on home improvements, and walking / hiking / sailing. It also provides ample opportunity to continue development of the game and/or other development projects and allows for a little downtime with a minimum one day free. 

As with all scenarios, this does not assume income needs at this time.

## Overall Week

- 1 day a week (5-10 hours): Supporting Rebuilding Together projects
- 1 day a week (16 hours): Committed to being open to do whatever sounds good for the day; whether that be a full day of gaming, a day of sailing, hiking, etc.
- 2-3 days a week (4-8 hrs/day): In the shop making furniture; depending on the activity for the day (e.g. build vs. staining) this would be half- to all-day activities
- 2 days a week (8 hrs/day): Continue improvements on the home (basement / bathroom remodels, building a patio, etc.)

- 4-5 days a week (1-3 hours): Development-related projects, such as the video game or IT projects for myself or non-profits
- 2-3 nights a week: I'll participate in social activities such as board-game nights, open-mic/live-music events, or just catching up with friends at a bar

_The following is just a sanity check for hours_

**Range of committed hours**; 49-81 before social activities

### Broader View 

- Travel (the type requireing flights) to visit family/friends and/or somewhere domestically each calendar quarter
- Travel internationally 2 times a year for 1-2 weeks each

### Relationship Adjustment

As my ideal outlook would involve a partner and, eventually, a family; I'm adjusting the WITL scenario to account for this scenario so it's being considered as we start to determine our constraints. 

- Depending on the activities of my partner, the above could adjust to account; however ideally I would have a partner that would support and even participate in some of the weekly activities with me
    -  Depending on how the projects are going, either the shop or the home improvement projects would be reduced by 1 and that day would be with my partner (still allowing for a day to decompress to the extent possible)
- I'm still of the opinion I would like children and the following is a (likey _very_ optimistic) adjusted ideal; unaccountedor time would be family and/or sleep: 
    - 1 day a week (5-10 hours): Supporting Rebuilding Together
    - 2 days a week (4-6 hours / day): Working in the shop
    - 3 days a week (1-3 hours): development activities (game, software project, etc.)

### Exploration Q&A

1. What might this scenario tell you about what's important, not important, and your relative heirarchy of values?
    - I'm realizing that this scenario is very, very heavily focusing on independence in how I work and having more physically active work. It's highlighting my desire to work how I want, have both physical and virtual outlets for creativity, and allocate some efforts to supporting others. 
1. What feels most appealing about this scenario?
    - For the most part it's complete and total independence in how I work.
1. What feels most exciting about this scenario?
    - Being a lot more active and seeing creations come to fruition in a physical, tangible way.
1. What seems most challenging about this scenario?
    - Social interaction as the majority of the activities are individual activities and having social interaction would have to be a specific effort vs. happening as part of the daily activities. A related challenge: the _fear_ around income generation (see next bullet because I think it really is more logistical).
1. What do you see as the biggest logistical hurdle(s) for this scenario?
    - The primary income generating activities in this scenario might be game related and furntiure building; both of which I'm novice at the very best at this time; so creating a sufficient income from this scenario would be the largest logistical hurdle (and the associated fear a challenge).
1. What experiments could you create to test aspects of these scenarios? ('minimum viable experiment' ?)
    - I've had one or two friends suggest maybe creating a piece of furniture and selling it on Etsy or something. I think that would be a viable minimum test because either I'll sell a piece of furniture and get excited or I won't sell the furniture and I'll have another piece to decorate the house; in either case it wouldn't be a wasted effort. 
    - Similarly, I could try to target developing a much, much smaller-scale game and attempeting to distrbute that product. Harder (I think) than creating and selling a piece of furniture, but potentially source of continuing income generation.

# Week in the Life (WITL) - Scenario 2

This scenario focuses heavily on travel and consulting, leaning in on the enjoyment of being able to help shape new ideas and foster creativity. 

As with all scenarios, this does not assume income needs at this time.

## Overall Week

- 3-4 days a week (6-14 hours): Travel on-site to meet with companies focused on new technologies that (hopefully) positively impact Earth and humanity to support them in creating business processes, fostering desired cultures, formulating messages, and architecting technology to support their vision. 
- 1 day a week: Shop or home remodling projects
- 1 day a week: Supporting Rebuilding together
- 1 day a week: Open for sanity / decompress
- 2-3 nights a week, I'll participate in social activities such as board-game nights, open-mic/live-music events, or just catching up with friends at a bar

_No sanity check here, the days are considered full and the 3-4 non-working days leave evenings open_

### Broader View 

- Travel (the type requireing flights) to visit family/friends and/or somewhere domestically each calendar quarter
- Travel internationally 2 times a year for 1-2 weeks each
- (Not factored into weekly with this plan): I would still find time for game development and/or independent software projects, likely a few nights a week, but not committed in this plan

### Relationship Adjustment

As my ideal outlook would involve a partner and, eventually, a family; I'm adjusting the WITL scenario to account for this scenario so it's being considered as we start to determine our constraints. 

- Depending on the activities of my partner, the above could adjust to account; however ideally I would have a partner that would support and even participate in some of the weekly activities with me
    - Very likely I'd reduce 
- I'm still of the opinion I would like children and the following is a (also likey _very_ optimistic) adjusted ideal; unaccounted-for time would be family and/or sleep:  
    - On-site travel would reduce 1-3 days, bi-weekly at most; other days would be virtual
    - 1 day for RT
    - 1 day for shop/home projects (expectation is duration may not officially drop, but productivty might with balancing family needs)
    - 1/2 day for decompress / sanity

### Exploration Q&A

1. What might this scenario tell you about what's important, not important, and your relative heirarchy of values?
    - Both scenarios focus on creativity, albeit this one is focused on creative solutions vs. the more physical outputs of the first scenario. Both scenarios focus on travel, which is important, but this one rachets it up significantly (though, more specifically: work should travel to new locations, so repeat locations would not be satisfying). Both scenarios also focus on autonomy, however the first scenario was near-complete autonomy while the second would still involve working with clients and their needs. I can't tell to what extent, but "the desire to feel important," is floating around in the mind. 
1. What feels most appealing about this scenario?
    - This still allows me to work in the aspect of consulting that I most enjoyed, which is an area of comfort, while also doing so on my own terms. 
1. What feels most exciting about this scenario?
    - The ability to resume traveling, exploring new cities, and getting to know new people
1. What seems most challenging about this scenario?
    - Developing the initial network and brand of someone that can support companies outside of Adobe products and/or purely from a technical development perspective. And this may add to challenges from a relationship perspective (counter: it may also help me find people whom are more like myself).
1. What do you see as the biggest logistical hurdle(s) for this scenario?
    - The initial time to accomplish building of a personal brand and consistent clientel, both for the actual marketing aspects and the associated business functions, may take far more time than outlined for a significant time (6-18 months) before things are consistent enough to start restricting the window to those 3-4 days. Also: the customers.
1. What experiments could you create to test aspects of these scenarios? ('minimum viable experiment' ?)
    - I could attend meetups / local conferences on technology and inquire and converse with various (ideally) business leaders and start to build a network
        - As that network pans out, maybe offer to assist pro-bono on some ideas and strategy; if they're happy with the conversations ask for reference or leads
    - I could refocus on Rebuilding Together and help them grow in their capabilities and use them for the same purpose (reference / lead) into other opportunities; non-profit or otherwise
    - I could possibly reach out to some of my contacts made along the way, introduce the idea, and get their input and advice (along with potential references)
