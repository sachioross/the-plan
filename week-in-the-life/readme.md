# Week in the Life (WITL) - Scenario 1

This scenario focuses heavily on being able to be active in my daily life: assisting efforts like Rebuilding Together projects, working on home improvements, and walking / hiking / sailing. It also provides ample opportunity to continue development of the game and/or other development projects and allows for a little downtime with a minimum one day free. 

As with all scenarios, this does not assume income needs at this time.

## Overall Week

- 1 day a week (5-10 hours): Supporting Rebuilding Together projects
- 1 day a week (16 hours): Committed to being open to do whatever sounds good for the day; whether that be a full day of gaming, a day of sailing, hiking, etc.
- 2-3 days a week (4-8 hrs/day): In the shop making furniture; depending on the activity for the day (e.g. build vs. staining) this would be half- to all-day activities
- 2 days a week (8 hrs/day): Continue improvements on the home (basement / bathroom remodels, building a patio, etc.)

- 4-5 days a week (1-3 hours): Development-related projects, such as the video game or IT projects for myself or non-profits
- 2-3 nights a week: I'll participate in social activities such as board-game nights, open-mic/live-music events, or just catching up with friends at a bar

_The following is just a sanity check for hours_

**Range of committed hours**; 49-81 before social activities

### Broader View 

- Travel (the type requireing flights) to visit family/friends and/or somewhere domestically each calendar quarter
- Travel internationally 2 times a year for 1-2 weeks each

### Relationship Adjustment

As my ideal outlook would involve a partner and, eventually, a family; I'm adjusting the WITL scenario to account for this scenario so it's being considered as we start to determine our constraints. 

- Depending on the activities of my partner, the above could adjust to account; however ideally I would have a partner that would support and even participate in some of the weekly activities with me
    -  Depending on how the projects are going, either the shop or the home improvement projects would be reduced by 1 and that day would be with my partner (still allowing for a day to decompress to the extent possible)
- I'm still of the opinion I would like children and the following is a (likey _very_ optimistic) adjusted ideal; unaccountedor time would be family and/or sleep: 
    - 1 day a week (5-10 hours): Supporting Rebuilding Together
    - 2 days a week (4-6 hours / day): Working in the shop
    - 3 days a week (1-3 hours): development activities (game, software project, etc.)

# Week in the Life (WITL) - Scenario 2

This scenario focuses heavily on travel and consulting, leaning in on the enjoyment of being able to help shape new ideas and foster creativity. 

As with all scenarios, this does not assume income needs at this time.

## Overall Week

- 3-4 days a week (6-14 hours): Travel on-site to meet with companies focused on new technologies that (hopefully) positively impact Earth and humanity to support them in creating business processes, fostering desired cultures, formulating messages, and architecting technology to support their vision. 
- 1 day a week: Shop or home remodling projects
- 1 day a week: Supporting Rebuilding together
- 1 day a week: Open for sanity / decompress
- 2-3 nights a week, I'll participate in social activities such as board-game nights, open-mic/live-music events, or just catching up with friends at a bar

_No sanity check here, the days are considered full and the 3-4 non-working days leave evenings open_

### Broader View 

- Travel (the type requireing flights) to visit family/friends and/or somewhere domestically each calendar quarter
- Travel internationally 2 times a year for 1-2 weeks each
- (Not factored into weekly with this plan): I would still find time for game development and/or independent software projects, likely a few nights a week, but not committed in this plan

### Relationship Adjustment

As my ideal outlook would involve a partner and, eventually, a family; I'm adjusting the WITL scenario to account for this scenario so it's being considered as we start to determine our constraints. 

- Depending on the activities of my partner, the above could adjust to account; however ideally I would have a partner that would support and even participate in some of the weekly activities with me
    - Very likely I'd reduce 
- I'm still of the opinion I would like children and the following is a (also likey _very_ optimistic) adjusted ideal; unaccounted-for time would be family and/or sleep:  
    - On-site travel would reduce 1-3 days, bi-weekly at most; other days would be virtual
    - 1 day for RT
    - 1 day for shop/home projects (expectation is duration may not officially drop, but productivty might with balancing family needs)
    - 1/2 day for decompress / sanity
